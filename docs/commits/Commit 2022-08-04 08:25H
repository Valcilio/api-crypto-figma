Added tests in dockerfile for continuous integration.

Warning:
    - Updating with a broke step in "tests/test_apigetdata.py" for testing the CI/CD process.

Additioned:
    - Dockerfile: new command to run pytest and to call just the necessary directories and files.
    - requirements.txt: added new lib "pytest" for CI/CD process.

Revised:
    - Dockerfile: excluded command to copy all files.
    - tests/test_data/test_df.csv: restaured for testing.
